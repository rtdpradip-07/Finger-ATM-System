# Finger-ATM-System

Overview
Finger ATM System is an advanced security system designed to enhance the authentication process for ATM transactions using fingerprint recognition technology. This project aims to replace traditional PIN-based authentication with a more secure and convenient biometric solution, improving both security and user experience.

The system leverages fingerprint scanning to authenticate users and provide access to their bank accounts, reducing the risk of fraud and identity theft associated with PINs and passwords. It is intended for use by financial institutions, technology enthusiasts, and security professionals interested in exploring biometric authentication solutions for banking and other secure applications.

Features
Fingerprint Authentication: Securely authenticate users via fingerprint recognition, eliminating the need for PINs or passwords.
User Registration: Allows users to register their fingerprints with the system for authentication.
Transaction Security: Provides secure access to account information and transaction processing.
Real-Time Verification: Quickly verifies fingerprints to provide instant access to users' accounts.
System Administration: Includes tools for managing user accounts and monitoring system performance.

Technologies Used
Programming Languages: 
Python, C++
Libraries: OpenCV, Numpy, SciPy, Fingerprint Recognition Libraries (e.g., NIST Biometric Image Software)
Hardware: Fingerprint Scanner
Development Environment: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with Python and C++ support
Installation
Prerequisites
Python (v3.6 or higher)
